The purpose of this web application is to allow friends to play games with each other. The basic functionality of the application would be to invite friends to a game session at a particular time, accepting or declining to join, and choosing games to play. Additionally, other functions such as creating/managing an account, adding friends, and viewing events will be included on the website. Because social interaction is limited with the COVID-19 pandemic, this application will act as a medium for people to interact with each other.
